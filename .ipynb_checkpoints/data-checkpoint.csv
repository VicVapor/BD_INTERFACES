Such an approach, combined with high throughput first-principles calculations and data-mining techniques, has led to exhaustive thermodynamic databases (e.g. compatible with the CALPHAD method), albeit focused on the reduced set of phases observed at distinct thermodynamic equilibria. In contrast, materials during their synthesis, operation, or processing, may not reach their thermodynamic equilibrium state but, instead, remain trapped in a local (metastable) free energy minimum, which may exhibit desirable properties. Here, we introduce an automated workflow that integrates first-principles physics and atomistic simulations with machine learning (ML), and high-performance computing to allow rapid exploration of the metastable phases to construct “metastable” phase diagrams for materials far-from-equilibrium. Using carbon as a prototypical system, we demonstrate automated metastable phase diagram construction to map hundreds of metastable states ranging from near equilibrium to far-from-equilibrium (400 meV/atom). We incorporate the free energy calculations into a neural-network-based learning of the equations of state that allows for efficient construction of metastable phase diagrams. We use the metastable phase diagram and identify domains of relative stability and synthesizability of metastable materials. High temperature high pressure experiments using a diamond anvil cell on graphite sample coupled with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) confirm our metastable phase predictions. In particular, we identify the previously ambiguous structure of n-diamond as a cubic-analog of diaphite-like lonsdaelite phase. © 2022, The Author(s).",,carbon; carbon; diagram; diamond anvil cell; physics; transmission electron microscopy; Article; calculation; chemical composition; controlled study; covalent bond; data mining; deep neural network; density functional theory; genetic algorithm; high resolution transmission electron microscopy; high temperature; hyperbaric pressure; machine learning; phase transition; physics; support vector machine; synthesis; workflow,"Wen, J.; Center for Nanoscale Materials, United States; email: jwen@anl.gov

Researchers are increasingly working with these large raster datasets that are often terabytes in size. At this scale, traditional GIS methods may fail to handle the processing, and new approaches are needed to analyse these datasets. The objective of this work is to develop methods to interactively analyse big raster datasets with the goal of most efficiently extracting vector data over specific time periods from any set of raster data. In this paper, we describe RINX (Raster INformation eXtraction) which is an end-to-end solution for automatic extraction of information from large raster datasets. RINX heavily utilises open source geospatial techniques for information extraction. It also complements traditional approaches with state-of-the- art high-performance computing techniques. This paper discusses details of achieving big temporal data extraction with RINX, implemented on the use case of air quality and climate data extraction for long term health studies, which includes methods used, code developed, processing time statistics, project conclusions, and next steps. © Copyright:",Big Data; Climate; Open Source; PostGIS; PRISM; Raster,Air quality; Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Data mining; Information retrieval; Large dataset; Open Data; Climate; Complex problems; Data extraction; Earth observation data; Geospatial science; Open-source; PostGIS; Processing approach; Raster; Times series; Climate change,"Kakkar, D.; Centre for Geographic Analysis, United States; email: kakkar@fas.harvard.edu",Brovelli M.A.Ciolli M.Minghini M.,International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing,16821750,,,,English,"Int.

Traditionally, remote sensing data must be transferred to the ground for processing. With the vigorous development of the commercial aerospace industry, computing, and high-speed laser inter-satellite link technologies, the interconnection of everything in the intelligent world has become an irreversible trend. Satellite remote sensing has entered the era of a big data link with IoT. On-orbit interpretation gives remote sensing images expanse application space. However, implementing on-orbit high-performance computing (HPC) is difficult; it is limited by the power and computer resource consumption of the satellite platform. Facing this challenge, building a processing algorithm with less computational complexity, less parameter quantity, high precision, and low computational power consumption is a key issue. In this paper, we propose a lightweight end-to-end SAR ship detector fused with the vision transformer encoder: YOLO−ViTSS. The experiment shows that YOLO−ViTSS has lightweight features, the model size is only 1.31 MB; it has anti-noise capability is suitable for processing SAR remote sensing images with native noise, and it also has high performance and low training energy consumption with 96.6 mAP on the SSDD dataset. These characteristics make YOLO−ViTSS suitable for porting to satellites for on-orbit processing and online learning. Furthermore, the ideas proposed in this paper help to build a cleaner and a more efficient new paradigm for remote sensing image interpretation. Migrating HPC tasks performed on the ground to on-orbit satellites and using solar energy to complete computing tasks is a more environmentally friendly option. This environmental advantage will gradually increase with the current construction of large-scale satellite constellations. The scheme proposed in this paper helps to build a novel real-time, eco-friendly, and sustainable SAR image interpretation mode. © 2022 by the authors.",eco-friendly IoT; lightweight deep learning algorithms; ship detection; synthetic aperture radar; vision transformer; YOLOv5,Internet; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; ship technology; synthetic aperture radar,"Xie, F.; Aerospace Information Research Institute, China; email: xief@microsate.com

However, current methods to estimate event-specific compound flooding at the household level require high-performance computing resources frequently not available to local stakeholders. Government and non-governmental agencies currently lack the methods to repeatedly and rapidly create flood impact maps that incorporate the local variability in both hazards and social vulnerability. We address this gap by developing a methodology to estimate a flood impact index at the household level in near-real time, utilizing high-resolution elevation data to approximate event-specific inundation from both pluvial and fluvial sources in conjunction with a social vulnerability index. Our analysis uses the 2015 Memorial Day flood in Austin, Texas, as a case study and proof of concept for our methodology. We show that 37% of the census block groups in the study area experience flooding from only pluvial sources and are not identified in local or national flood hazard maps as being at risk. Furthermore, averaging hazard estimates to cartographic boundaries masks household variability, with 60% of the census block groups in the study area having a coefficient of variation around the mean flood depth exceeding 50%. Comparing our pluvial flooding estimates to a 2D physics-based model, we classify household impact accurately for 92% of households. Our methodology can be used as a tool to create household compound flood impact maps to provide computationally efficient information to local stakeholders. © 2022 Matthew Preisser et al.",,Floods; Surveys; Block group; Event-specific; Floodings; Fluvials; Household level; Impact index; Near-real time; Pluvials; Social vulnerability; Study areas; Hazards; flood; household structure; mapping; vulnerability,"Passalacqua, P.; Environmental and Water Resources Engineering, United States; email: paola@austin.utexas.edu",,Copernicus GmbH,10275606,,,,English,Hydrol.

However, existing detection networks are mostly based on large-scale models and high-cost computations, which require high-performance computing equipment to realize real-time processing and limit their hardware transplantation to onboard platforms. To address this problem, a lightweight ship detection network via YOLOX-s is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we remove the computationally heavy pyramidal structure and build a streamlined network based on a one-level feature for higher detection efficiency. Secondly, to expand the limited receptive field and enhance the semantic information of a single-feature map, a residual asymmetric dilated convolution (RADC) block is proposed. Through four branches with different dilation rates, the RADC block can help the detector to capture various ships in complex backgrounds. Finally, to tackle the imbalance problem between ships of different scales in the training stage, we put forward a balanced label assignment strategy called center-based uniform matching. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on the SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) and High-Resolution SAR Images Dataset (HRSID). The results show that our method can achieve comparable performance to general detection networks with much less computational cost. © 2022 by the authors.",convolutional neural network (CNN); lightweight model; one-level feature; ship detection; synthetic aperture radar (SAR),Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Radar imaging; Semantics; Ships; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Convolutional neural network; Detection methods; Detection networks; Lightweight model; Network-based; One-level feature; Ship detection; Synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar images; Convolution,"Yu, Z.; Aerospace Information Research Institute, China; email: yuzj@ucas.ac.cn",,MDPI,20724292,,,,English,Remote Sens.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136424655

In the absence of comprehensive traffic monitoring networks with the general lack of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) and big-data-driven, high-performance-computing (HPC) platforms, it remains challenging to constrain on-road vehicle emissions and capture their hotspots. Here, we established an intelligent modelling and visualization system driven by ITS traffic data for real-world, on-road vehicle emissions. Based on the HPC platform (named “City Brain”) and an agile Web Geographic Information System (WebGISs), this system can map real-time (hourly), hyperfine (10~1000 m) vehicle emissions (e.g., PM2.5, NOx, CO, and HC) and associated traffic states (e.g., vehicle-specific categories and traffic fluxes) over the Xiaoshan District in Hangzhou. Our results show sharp variations in on-road vehicle emissions on small scales, which even fluctuated up to 31.2 times within adjacent road links. Frequent and widespread emission hotspots were also exposed. Over custom spatiotemporal scopes, we virtually investigated and visualized the impacts of traffic control policies on the traffic states and on-road vehicle emissions. Such results have important implications for how traffic control policies should be optimized. Integrating this system with chemical transport models and air quality measurements would bridge the technical gap between air pollutant emissions, concentrations, and human exposure. © 2022 by the authors.

Downscaled LU/LC maps for Switzerland were obtained for three time periods by blending two inputs: the Swiss topographic base map at a 1:25,000 scale and the national LU/LC statistics obtained from aerial photointerpretation on a 100 m regular lattice of points. The spatial resolution of the resulting LU/LC map was improved by a factor of 16 to reach a resolution of 25 m, while the thematic resolution was increased from 29 (in the base map) to 62 land use categories. The method combines a simple inverse distance spatial weighting of 36 nearest neighbors’ information and an expert system of correspondence between input base map categories and possible output LU/LC types. The developed algorithm, written in Python, reads and writes gridded layers of more than 64 million pixels. Given the size of the analyzed area, a High‐Performance Computing (HPC) cluster was used to parallelize the data and the analysis and to obtain results more efficiently.

The aim of the work is to create a new approach to the analysis and forecasting of the multidimensional degradation processes of floodplain territories under the influence of natural and technogenic factors. This approach uses methods of hydrodynamic and geoinformation modeling, statistical analysis of observational data and results of high-performance computational experiments. The basis of our approach is the dynamics model of the complex structure of the floodplain. This structure combines the characteristics of the frequency ranges of flooding and the socio-environmental features of various sites (cadastral data of land use). Modeling of the hydrological regime is based on numerical shallow water models. The regression model of the technogenic dynamics of the riverbed allowed us to calculate corrections to the parameters of real floods that imitate the effect of this factor. This made it possible to use digital maps of the modern topography for hydrodynamic modeling and the construction of floods maps for past and future decades. The technological basis of our study is a set of algorithms and software, consisting of three modules. The data module includes, first of all, the cadastres of the territory of the Volga-Akhtuba floodplain (VAF, this floodplain is the interfluve of the Volga and Akhtuba rivers for the last 400 km before flowing into the Caspian Sea), satellite and natural observation data, spatial distributions of parameters of geoinformation and hydrodynamic models. The second module provides the construction of a multilayer digital model of the floodplain area, digital maps of floods and their aggregated characteristics. The third module calculates a complex territorial structure, criteria for the state of the environmental and socio-economic system (ESES) and a forecast of its changes. We have shown that the degradation of the ESES of the northern part of the VAF is caused by the negative dynamics of the hydrological structure of its territory, due to the technogenic influence the hydroelectric power station on the Volga riverbed. This dynamic manifests itself in a decrease in the stable flooded area and an increase in the unflooded and unstable flooded areas. An important result is the forecast of the complex territorial structure and criteria for the state of the interfluve until 2050. © 2022 by the authors.

However, with great sequencing comes great computation, and while cloud computing platforms bring high-performance computing directly into the hands of all who seek it, optimal design and configuration of a cloud compute cluster requires significant system administration expertise. We developed ViReflow, a user-friendly viral consensus sequence reconstruction pipeline enabling rapid analysis of viral sequence datasets leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud compute resources and the Reflow system. ViReflow was developed specifically in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is general to any viral pathogen. Importantly, when utilized with sufficient compute resources, ViReflow can trim, map, call variants, and call consensus sequences from amplicon sequence data from 1000 SARS-CoV-2 samples at 1000X depth in < 10 min, with no user intervention.

Existing methods for bathymetry mapping require intensive and costly field surveys or targeted aerial captures, neither of which are easily or affordably replicated for repeat mapping and change monitoring. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB), however, offers the potential to map shallow water bodies repeatedly and efficiently with high spatial and temporal resolution (i.e., daily-weekly at 5 m or better). One challenge to large-scale implementation of SDB lies in the automated derivation of inherent water column properties such that they may be accurately compensated for across a variety of depth and substrate conditions. Here we present an algorithm that leverages WorldView (Maxar/Digital GlobeTM) satellite imagery to map the entire 3700 km2 Florida Keys (USA) island chain at 2-meter resolution without the need for any in-situ data collections. Preprocessing included radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, automated deglinting, and automated detection of optically deep water, which was then used to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration assuming that the study area is primarily comprised of Case-I water (i.e., those where the optical signal is dominated by water, Chlorophyll-a in phytoplankton, and properties that vary in proportion to Chlorophyll-a concentration). Estimating Chlorophyll-a concentration allowed us to calculate the appropriate tuning coefficients used in a spectral band ratio equation for estimating bathymetry. The entire process was fully automated from ingestion of Level-1B image to bathymetry raster output. Mapping the Florida Keys from Key Largo to Key West required 34 WorldView images and was completed in approximately 27 min for an average processing time of 47 s per image using a single GPU core (i.e., supercomputing resources were not needed). After combining the products (mosaicking) in ArcMap, the wall-to-wall bathymetry map was validated against a LiDAR-derived bathymetry model with over 600,000 points; results show an RMSE of 1.95 m over depths from 0 to 15 m. © 2022",Chlorophyll; High-performance computing; Turbidity; WorldView,algorithm; automation; bathymetric survey; chlorophyll; coastal zone; field survey; resolution; satellite imagery; shallow water; spatiotemporal analysis; turbidity; WorldView; Florida Keys; Florida [United States]; Key Largo; United States,"McCarthy, M.J.; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 1 Bethel Valley Road, United States; email: mccarthymj@ornl.gov",,Elsevier B.V.,15698432,,,,English,Int.

The semantic reconstruction of the scene is a truly functional understanding of the environment. However, high-performance computing is generally not available on most UAVs, so a lightweight real-time semantic reconstruction method is necessary. Existing methods rely on GPU, and it is difficult to achieve real-time semantic reconstruction on CPU. To solve the problem, an indoor dense semantic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) method using CPU computing is proposed in this paper, named CDSFusion. The CDSFusion is the first system integrating RGBD-based Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), semantic segmentation and 3D reconstruction in real-time on a CPU. In our VIO method, the depth information is introduced to improve the accuracy of pose estimation, and FAST features are used for faster tracking. In our semantic reconstruction method, the PSPNet (Pyramid Scene Parsing Network) pre-trained model is optimized to provide the semantic information in real-time on the CPU, and the semantic point clouds are fused using Voxblox. The experimental results demonstrate that camera tracking is accelerated without loss of accuracy in our VIO, and a 3D semantic map is reconstructed in real-time, which is comparable to one generated by the GPU-dependent method. © 2022 by the authors.

The near real-time (NRT) change detection of forest cover loss enables forest landowners, government agencies and local communities to monitor natural and anthropogenic disturbances in a much timelier fashion than the thematic maps that are released every year. NRT deforestation alerts enable the establishment of more up-to-date forest inventories and rapid responses to unlicensed logging. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites provide operational Earth observation (EO) data from multi-spectral optical/near-infrared wavelengths every five days at a global scale and at 10 m resolution. The amount of acquired data requires cloud computing or high-performance computing for ongoing monitoring systems and an automated system for processing, analyzing and delivering the information promptly. Here, we present a Sentinel-2-based NRT change detection system, assess its performance over two study sites, Manantlán in Mexico and Cartagena del Chairá in Colombia, and evaluate the forest changes that occurred in 2018. An independent validation with very high-reso-lution PlanetScope (~3 m) and RapidEye (~5 m) data suggests that the proposed NRT change detection system can accurately detect forest cover loss (> 87%), other vegetation loss (> 76%) and other vegetation gain (> 71%). Furthermore, the proposed NRT change detection system is designed to be attuned using in situ data. Therefore, it is scalable to larger regions, entire countries and even con-tinents. © 2022 by the authors.

Although deterministic mathematical models are available, in most cases, parameters and initial conditions for the equations are usually only known within a prescribed range of uncertainty. For the construction of probabilistic hazard assessments, accurate outputs and propagation of the inherent input uncertainty to quantities of interest are needed to estimate necessary probabilities based on numerous runs of the underlying deterministic model. Characterizing the uncertainty in system states due to parametric and input uncertainty, simultaneously, requires using ensemble based methods to explore the full parameter and input spaces. Complex tasks, such as running thousands of instances of a deterministic model with parameter and input uncertainty require a High Performance Computing infrastructure and skilled personnel that may not be readily available to the policy makers responsible for making informed risk mitigation decisions. For efficiency, programming tasks required for executing ensemble simulations need to run in parallel, leading to twin computational challenges of managing large amounts of data and performing CPU intensive processing. The resulting flow of work requires complex sequences of tasks, interactions, and exchanges of data, hence the automatic management of these workflows are essential. Here we discuss a computer infrastructure, methodology and tools which enable scientists and other members of the volcanology research community to develop workflows for construction of probabilistic hazard maps using remotely accessed computing through a web portal.

During the whole process, only two internal parameters A and C are utilized for the control of the exploration and development process. BWOA is simple to implement. In the process of algorithm execution, the initial population, global exploration, and local development stages have shortcomings. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the WOA algorithm. Based on WOA, this study conducts a high-performance computing analysis and location selection of logistics distribution center space. It is concluded that: (1) by using the combination of direct logistics distribution and hierarchical logistics distribution, the WOA algorithm optimizes the cross selection strategy, the population fitness S-LO is improved, the quality of LA is guaranteed, and the chaotic S-LO mapping eliminates inferior individuals in the population. Direct distribution is carried out for bulky goods and important distribution customers, and hierarchical logistics distribution is used for customers in intensive logistics distribution destinations. (2) WOA uses the second reverse learning, chaotic mapping, and logistic chaotic mapping to improve the location update mode. The direct distribution method is mostly used for the logistics business with short journeys, fixed distribution points, and more goods delivered at one time, and logistics enterprises do not need to store and distribute goods. The uniform ergodicity of the Tent chaotic map and logistic chaotic map is improved. Ka adaptive inertia weights are a good complement to optimize the limitations of the Ao whale algorithm. (3) The inertia weight of the levy flight behavior can play a powerful role in balancing the global exploration ability and optimization performance of the intelligent algorithm. The long-term short-distance search of HED and the long-distance jump of KVAR are combined. Variant individuals undergo vector synthesis. It reduces the construction and operation costs of logistics sites and is suitable for logistics distribution under specific conditions.

A major concern on VGI data quality is that the underlying observation processes are inherently biased. Detecting observation hot-spots thus helps better understand the bias. Enabled by the parallel kernel density estimation (KDE) computational tool that can run on multiple GPUs (graphics processing units), this study conducted point pattern analyses on tens of millions of iNaturalist observations to detect and visualize volunteers’ observation hot-spots across spatial scales. It was achieved by setting varying KDE bandwidths in accordance with the spatial scales at which hot-spots are to be detected. The succession of estimated density surfaces were then rendered at a sequence of map scales for visual detection of hot-spots. This study offers an effective geovisualization scheme for hierarchically detecting hot-spots in massive VGI datasets, which is useful for understanding the pattern-shaping drivers that operate at multiple spatial scales. This research exemplifies a computational tool that is supported by high-performance computing and capable of efficiently detecting and visualizing multi-scale hot-spots in geospatial big data and contributes to expanding the toolbox for geospatial big data analytics. © 2022 by the author.

Despite their major importance, the knowledge of the main characteristics of the majority of coastal areas (e.g., coastal bathymetry) is still very limited. This is mainly due to the scarcity and lack of accurate measurements or observations, and the sparsity of coastal waters. Moreover, the high cost of performing observations with conventional methods does not allow expansion of the monitoring chain in different coastal areas. In this study, we suggest that the advent of remote sensing data (e.g., Sentinel 2A/B) and high performance computing could open a new perspective to overcome the lack of coastal observations. Indeed, previous research has shown that it is possible to derive large-scale coastal bathymetry from S-2 images. The large S-2 coverage, however, leads to a high computational cost when post-processing the images. Thus, we develop a methodology implemented on a High-Performance cluster (HPC) to derive the bathymetry from S-2 over the globe. In this paper, we describe the conceptualization and implementation of this methodology. Moreover, we will give a general overview of the generated bathymetry map for NA compared with the reference GEBCO global bathymetric product. Finally, we will highlight some hotspots by looking closely to their outputs. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the existing computational methods lack high efficiency and precision segmentation for the vascular ends and thin retina vessels. It is important to construct a reliable and quantitative automatic diagnostic method for improving the diagnosis efficiency. In this study, we propose a multichannel deep neural network for retina vessel segmentation. First, we apply U-net on original and thin (or thick) vessels for multi-objective optimization for purposively training thick and thin vessels. Then, we design a specific fusion mechanism for combining three kinds of prediction probability maps into a final binary segmentation map. Experiments show that our method can effectively improve the segmentation performances of thin blood vessels and vascular ends. It outperforms many current excellent vessel segmentation methods on three public datasets. In particular, it is pretty impressive that we achieve the best F1-score of 0.8247 on the DRIVE dataset and 0.8239 on the STARE dataset.

We demonstrate the application of task farming to reduce runtime for ADMS-Urban, a quasi-Gaussian plume air dispersion model. The model represents the full range of source types (point, road and grid sources) occurring in an urban area at high resolution. Here, we implement and evaluate the option to automatically split up a large model domain into smaller sub-regions, each of which can then be executed concurrently on multiple cores of a HPC or across a PC network, a technique known as task farming. The approach has been tested for a large model domain covering the West Midlands, UK (902 km2 ), as part of modelling work in the WM-Air (West Midlands Air Quality Improvement Programme) project. Compared to the measurement data, overall, the model performs well. Air quality maps for annual/subset averages and percentiles are generated. For this air quality modelling application of task farming, the optimisation process has reduced weeks of model execution time to approximately 35 h for a single model configuration of annual calculations. © 2021 by the authors.

In Turkey, National Parks are one of the protected areas managed according to the National Parks Law No. 2873. Among them, the Ä°ǧneada Floodplain Forests National Park, located in Igneada town in the province of Klrklareli, Turkey has been declared as a national park in 2007, and has an importance being a rare ecosystem, which consists of wetland, swamp, lakes and coastal sand dunes. Planning of Protected Areas can be done in a variety of ways, taking into account the balance of protection/use and should follow policies and guidelines. Today, for the sustainability and effective management of forest ecosystems, remote sensing technology provides an effective tool for assessing and monitoring ecosystem health at different temporal and spatial scales. In this study, potential temporal changes in the National Park were analyzed with Landsat satellite time series images using two different methods. First method, the Landtrendr algorithm (Landsat-based Detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery) developed for multitemporal satellite data, uses pixel values as input data and analysis them by using regression models to capture, label and map the changes. In this context, Landsat satellite time series images were taken quinquennial between 1987 and 2007 and biennially until 2017 for Landtrendr analysis (i.e. before and after its declaration as a National Park, respectively). As a second approach, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-based platform, which facilitates access to high-performance computing resources to process large long-term data sets, was used to analyze the impact of land cover changes. The results showed that the area was subjected to various pressures (i.e. due to illegal felling, pollution, etc.) until it was declared as a National park. Although there was general improvement and recovery after the region declared as a Park, it was seen that the sensitive dynamics of the region require continuous monitoring and protection using geo-information technologies. © 2021 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.

At present, commonly used radar-based algorithms for microwave imaging are based on the delay and sum algorithm. These algorithms use ultra-wideband signals to reconstruct a 2D image of the targeted object or region. Delay multiply and sum is an extended version of the delay and sum algorithm. However, it is computationally expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, the delay multiply and sum algorithm is parallelised using a big data framework. The algorithm uses the Spark MapReduce programming model to improve its efficiency. The most computational part of the algorithm is pixel value calculation, where signals need to be multiplied in pairs and summed. The proposed algorithm broadcasts the input data and executes it in parallel in a distributed manner. The Spark-based parallel algorithm is compared with sequential and Python multiprocessing library implementation. The experimental results on both a standalone machine and a high-performance cluster show that Spark significantly accelerates the image reconstruction process without affecting its accuracy. © 2021 by the authors.

Mapping urban areas is essential for understanding land cover change, carbon cycles, and climate change (urban areas also refer to impervious surfaces, i.e., artificial cover and structures). Remote sensing has greatly advanced urban areas mapping over the last several decades. At present, we have entered the era of big data. Long time series of satellite data such as Landsat and high-performance computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) offer new opportunities to map urban areas. The objective of this research was to determine how annual time series images from Landsat 8 OLI can effectively be composed to map urban areas in three cities in China in support of GEE. Three reducer functions, ee.Reducer.min(), ee.Reducer.median(), and ee.Reducer.max() provided by GEE, were selected to construct four schemes to synthesize the annual intensive time series Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for three cities in China. Then, urban areas were mapped based on the random forest algorithm and the accuracy was evaluated in detail. The results show that (1) the quality of annual composite images was improved significantly, particularly in reducing the impact of cloud and cloud shadows, and (2) the annual composite images obtained by the combination of multiple reducer functions had better performance than that obtained by a single reducer function. Further, the overall accuracy of urban areas mapping with the combination of multiple reducer functions exceeded 90% in all three cities in China. In summary, a suitable combination of reducer functions for synthesizing annual time series images can enhance data quality and ensure differences between characteristics and higher precision for urban areas mapping. © 2021 by the authors.

The main purpose of RNA-Seq analysis is to find out the presence and quantity of RNA in an experimental sample under a specific condition. Essentially, RNA raw sequence data was massive. It can be as big as hundreds of Gigabytes (GB). This massive data always makes the processing time become longer and take several days. A multicore processor can speed up a program by separating the tasks and running the tasks’ errands concurrently. Hence, a multicore processor will be a suitable choice to overcome this problem. Therefore, this study aims to use an Intel multicore processor to improve the RNA-Seq speed and analyze RNA-Seq analysis's performance with a multiprocessor. This study only processed RNA-Seq from quality control analysis until sorted the BAM (Binary Alignment/Map) file content. Three different sizes of RNA paired end has been used to make the comparison. The final experiment results showed that the implementation of RNA-Seq on an Intel multicore processor could achieve a higher speedup. The total processing time of RNA-Seq with the largest size of RNA raw sequence data (66.3 Megabytes) decreased from 317.638 seconds to 211.916 seconds. The reduced processing time was 105 seconds and near to 2 minutes. Furthermore, for the smallest RNA raw sequence data size, the total processing time decreased from 212.380 seconds to 163.961 seconds which reduced 48 seconds. © 2021 University of Baghdad.

High spatial resolution commercial satellite imagery enables transformational opportunities to observe, map, and document the micro-topographic transitions occurring in Arctic polygonal tundra at multiple spatial and temporal frequencies. The entire Arctic has been imaged at 0.5 m or finer resolution by commercial satellite sensors. The imagery is still largely underutilized, and value-added Arctic science products are rare. Knowledge discovery through artificial intelligence (AI), big imagery, high performance computing (HPC) resources is just starting to be realized in Arctic science. Large-scale deployment of petabyte-scale imagery resources requires sophisticated computational approaches to automated image interpretation coupled with efficient use of HPC resources. In addition to semantic complexities, multitude factors that are inherent to sub-meter resolution satellite imagery, such as file size, dimensions, spectral channels, overlaps, spatial references, and imaging conditions challenge the direct translation of AI-based approaches from computer vision applications. Memory limitations of Graphical Processing Units necessitates the partitioning of an input satellite imagery into manageable sub-arrays, followed by parallel predictions and post-processing to reconstruct the results corresponding to input image dimensions and spatial reference. We have developed a novel high performance image analysis framework – Mapping application for Arctic Permafrost Land Environment (MAPLE) that enables the integration of operational-scale GeoAI capabilities into Arctic science applications. We have designed the MAPLE workflow to become interoperable across HPC architectures while utilizing the optimal use of computing resources. © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

In this study, we focused on an automated global burn severity mapping approach. Using the catalogue of satellite imagery and the high-performance computing power of GoogleEarthEngine we propose an automated pipeline to generate severity maps of burned areas at a medium scale of 30 and 10m from the time series of Landsat and Sentinel2 images. Landsat-8 images available during 2020 and the dNBR spectral index were used to calculate the severity level of each pixel using a calibration model and linear regression adjustments, which were taken in the field from the CBI index in an app developed for field capture. A calibration approach was carried out to give the severity level of the final burned areas after several carefully designed logic filters on the normalized burn rate (NBR). This script focuses on the fires that occurred in Honduras in 2020. The regression model found a similar spatial distribution and strong correlation between the areas analyzed in the field and those generated from the dNBR. The preliminary global validation showed that the overall accuracy reached 53.85%. However, the adjustments through the correlation models improved the results, yielding an R2of 0.93 for the quadratic model, 0.79 for the Exponential model and 0.72 for the linear model. © 2021 UNIV SAOPAULO.

Password recovery based on the hash algorithm is an important means of electronic forensics, encrypted information restoration, illegal information filtering, and network security maintenance. The traditional password recovery system is based mainly on the CPU and GPU and has a low energy efficiency ratio and cracking efficiency and cannot meet high-performance computing requirements. To further improve the computational efficiency and application flexibility of password recovery algorithms, this paper proposes a reconfigurable computing kernel design method based on a hybrid reconfigurable computing array (HRCA). Through in-depth analysis of the hash algorithm, the basic computing kernel set is extracted, and the combination design is carried out from the unit kernel, interconnection and storage structure to reconstruct the hash algorithm to match the application with the appropriate structure. Second, combined with the pipeline technology, the full pipeline hash and high-speed password attack algorithms are optimized and implemented to meet the needs of high-performance computing. Finally, an advanced computing kernel library is established, and the combination of a computing kernel map from the control and communication levels to achieve multidimensional reconfigurable computing and an overall placement strategy is used to make full use of the chip resources to improve computational efficiency. The experimental results and analysis show that compared with traditional CPU and GPU methods, the password recovery algorithm designed in this paper has the highest cracking speeds at 78.22 times and 2.65 times that of the CPU and GPU, respectively, and the highest energy efficiency ratio is 25.88 times and 3.16 times that of the CPU and GPU, respectively. Furthermore, the recovery efficiency has been significantly improved and meets the requirements of high-performance password recovery computing. © 2013 IEEE.",computing kernel; hash algorithm; HRCA; password recovery; reconfigurable,Authentication; Computer system recovery; Energy efficiency; Green computing; Hash functions; Information filtering; Network protocols; Network security; Pipelines; Reconfigurable architectures; Recovery; Communication levels; Cryptographic algorithms; Encrypted informations; Energy efficiency ratio; High performance computing; Password recoveries; Reconfigurable computing; Security maintenance; Computational efficiency,"Li, B.; School of Information Engineering, China; email: cctvlibin@163.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099733774

They are difficult for non-experts to use and are often slow in completing the complicated geographic analysis. To address these problems, future generation of GIS software must be ‘easy’. By ‘easy’ we mean ‘easy to use’ and ‘easy to compute’. ‘Easy to use’ means that software system should be goal-oriented, rather than the currently procedure-oriented doctrine. The goal-oriented will relieve users, particularly novice users, the burden of knowing the exact commands and their sequences to perform for achieving the goal they want to achieve. ‘Easy to compute’ means that implementation of GIS analytical functionality should be able to utilize the high-performance computing infrastructures for complicated geographic analysis. Two case studies, one in digital soil mapping and the other in digital terrain analysis, are presented to illustrate the meaning of ‘easy’.

Rampant timber theft in the country makes these circumstances worse. The emergence of cloud-based platforms, such as Google Earth Engine (GEE), has greatly improved the accessibility and usability of high spatial and temporal Sentinel-1 and-2 data, especially in data-poor countries that lack high-performance computing systems for forest monitoring. Here, we demonstrate the potential of these resources for forest harvest detection. The results showed that Sentinel-1 data are efficient in detecting clear-cut events; both VH and VV backscatter signals decline sharply in accordance with clear-cutting and increase again when forest biomass increases. When correlated with highly responsive NDII, the VH and VV signals reached the best accuracies of 0.79 and 0.83, whereas the SWIR1 achieved –0.91. A Random Forest (RF) algorithm based on Sentinel-2 data also achieved over 90% accuracies for classifying harvested and forested areas. Overall, our study presents a cost-effective method for mapping clear-cut events in an economically important forestry area of South Africa while using GEE resources. © 2020 by the authors.

The system includes four main processing procedures to obtain spatio-temporal velocity changes: (1) preparing ambient-noise data; (2) creating virtual seismograms between pairs of seismometer stations by applying seismic interferometry; (3) estimating temporal velocity variations from virtual seismograms by stretching interpolation approach, and (4) mapping spatio-temporal velocity variations. We developed a data-processing scheme that removes unstable stretching interpolation results by using the median absolute deviation technique and a median filter. To map velocity changes with high stability and high temporal resolution during long-term (i.e., longer-term monitoring), we proposed the “sliding reference method”. We also developed evaluation method to select the optimum parameters related to stability and temporal resolution. To reduce computation time for continuous monitoring, we applied parallel computation methods, such as shared memory and hybrid distributed memory parallelization. Using our efficient and stable monitoring system, we succeeded to continuously monitor the spatio-temporal velocity variation of the whole Japanese Islands using ambient-noise data from 767 seismometers. Finally, we developed a web application that displays spatio-temporal velocity changes. In the monitoring results that we open through the website, we identified velocity variation (e.g., pore pressure variation) that could be related to earthquake, aftershock, magmatic activities and environmental effects in a stable manner.

Remote sensing has become a primary instrument to monitor the land use dynamics surrounding mangrove ecosystems. Where studies formerly relied on bi-temporal assessments of change, the practical limitations concerning data-availability and processing power are slowly disappearing with the onset of high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud-computing services, such as in the Google Earth Engine (GEE). This paper combines the capabilities of GEE, including its entire Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 archives and state-of-the-art classification approaches, with a post-classification temporal analysis to optimize land use classification results into gap-free and consistent information. The results demonstrate its application and value to uncover the spatio-temporal dynamics of mangrove forests and land use changes in Ngoc Hien District, Ca Mau province, Vietnamese Mekong delta. The combination of repeated GEE classification output and post-classification optimization provides valid spatial classification (94–96% accuracy) and temporal interpolation (87–92% accuracy). The findings reveal that the net change of mangroves forests over the 2001–2019 period equals −0.01% annually. The annual gap-free maps enable spatial identification of hotspots of mangrove forest changes, including deforestation and degradation. Post-classification temporal optimization allows for an exploitation of temporal patterns to synthesize and enhance independent classifications towards more robust gap-free spatial maps that are temporally consistent with logical land use transitions. The study contributes to a growing body of work advocating full exploitation of temporal information in optimizing land cover classification and demonstrates its use for mangrove forest monitoring. © MDPI AG.

Recent technological advances allow the easy generation of data with hundreds of millions of single-cell data points with >40 parameters, originating from thousands of individual samples. The analysis of that amount of high-dimensional data becomes demanding in both hardware and software of high-performance computational resources. Current software tools often do not scale to the datasets of such size; users are thus forced to downsample the data to bearable sizes, in turn losing accuracy and ability to detect many underlying complex phenomena. Results: We present GigaSOM.jl, a fast and scalable implementation of clustering and dimensionality reduction for flow and mass cytometry data. The implementation of GigaSOM.jl in the high-level and high-performance programming language Julia makes it accessible to the scientific community and allows for efficient handling and processing of datasets with billions of data points using distributed computing infrastructures. We describe the design of GigaSOM.jl, measure its performance and horizontal scaling capability, and showcase the functionality on a large dataset from a recent study. Conclusions: GigaSOM.jl facilitates the use of commonly available high-performance computing resources to process the largest available datasets within minutes, while producing results of the same quality as the current state-of-art software. Measurements indicate that the performance scales to much larger datasets. The example use on the data from a massive mouse phenotyping effort confirms the applicability of GigaSOM.jl to huge-scale studies. © 2020 The Author(s).

There have been proposed different tools and methods for finding Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) among different samples, but the execution time required by these tools is large, and the visualization of their results is far from being interactive. Additionally, these methods show more accurate results when identifying simulated DM regions that are long and have small within-group variation, but they have low concordance when used with real datasets, probably due to the different approaches they use for DMR identification. Thus, a tool which automatically detects DMRs among different samples and interactively visualizes DMRs at different scales (from a bunch to ten of millions of DNA locations) can be the key for shortening the DNA methylation analysis process in many studies. Results: In this paper, we propose a software tool based on the wavelet transform. This mathematical tool allows the fast automatic DMR detection by simple comparison of different signals at different resolution levels. Also, it allows an interactive visualization of the DMRs found at different resolution levels. The tool is publicly available at https://grev-uv.github.io/, and it is part of a complete suite of tools which allow to carry out the complete process of DNA alignment and methylation analysis, creation of methylation maps of the whole genome, and the detection and visualization of DMRs between different samples. Conclusions: The validation of the developed software tool shows similar concordance with other well-known and extended tools when used with real and synthetic data. The batch mode of the tool is capable of automatically detecting the existing DMRs for half (twelve) of the human chromosomes between two sets of six samples (whose.csv files after the alignment and mapping procedures have an aggregated size of 108 Gigabytes) in around three hours and a half. When compared to other well-known tools, HPG-DHunter only requires around 15% of the execution time required by other tools for detecting the DMRs. © 2020 The Author(s).",DNA methylation; GPU computing; High performance computing; Wavelet transform,"Alkylation; Chromosomes; Computer software; DNA; Methylation; Visualization; Wavelet transforms; Different resolutions; DNA Methylation; DNA methylation analysis; Human chromosomes; Interactive visualizations; Mathematical tools; Methylation analysis; Tools and methods; Bioinformatics; article; clinical article; DNA methylation; human; human chromosome; software; validation process; wavelet transform; DNA methylation; DNA sequence; genetics; procedures; DNA Methylation; Humans; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Software","Orduña, J.M.; Departamento de Informática, Avda.

In addition to the general challenges common to all software development projects, research software must also represent, manipulate, and provide data for complex theoretical constructs. Ensuring this process of theory-software translation is robust is essential to maintaining the integrity of the science resulting from it, and yet there has been little formal recognition or exploration of the challenges associated with it. Methods: We thematically analyse the outputs of the discussion sessions at the Theory-Software Translation Workshop 2019, where academic researchers and research software engineers from a variety of domains, and with particular expertise in high performance computing, explored the process of translating between scientific theory and software. Results: We identify a wide range of challenges to implementing scientific theory in research software and using the resulting data and models for the advancement of knowledge. We categorise these within the emergent themes of design, infrastructure, and culture, and map them to associated research questions. Conclusions: Systematically investigating how software is constructed and its outputs used within science has the potential to improve the robustness of research software and accelerate progress in its development. We propose that this issue be examined within a new research area of theory-software translation, which would aim to significantly advance both knowledge and scientific practice. © 2020 Jay C et al.",High performance computing; Research software; Research software engineering; Scientific computing; Scientific software; Scientific software development,article; language; software; theoretical study; computer analysis; engineering; human; knowledge; personnel; Computing Methodologies; Engineering; Humans; Knowledge; Research Personnel; Software,"Jay, C.; University of ManchesterUnited Kingdom; email: Caroline.Jay@manchester.ac.uk",,F1000 Research Ltd,20461402,,,33214878,English,F1000 Res.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096353952

The cornerstone of this evolution is the field programmable gate array, a building block enabling the configuration of a custom hardware architecture. The departure from static von Neumann-like architectures opens the way to eliminate the instruction overhead and to optimize the execution speed and power consumption. FPGAs now live in a growing ecosystem of development tools, enabling software programmers to map algorithms directly onto hardware. Applications abound in many directions, including data centers, IoT, AI, image processing and space exploration. The increasing success of FPGAs is largely due to an improved toolchain with solid high-level synthesis support as well as a better integration with processor and memory systems. On the other hand, long compile times and complex design exploration remain areas for improvement. In this paper we address the evolution of FPGAs towards advanced multi-functional accelerators, discuss different programming models and their HLS language implementations, as well as high-performance tuning of FPGAs integrated into a heterogeneous platform. We pinpoint fallacies and pitfalls, and identify opportunities for language enhancements and architectural refinements. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.",Design space exploration; FPGAs; High-level synthesis; High-performance computing,,"D'Hollander, E.H.; Electronics and Information Systems Department, Belgium; email: Erik.DHollander@UGent.be",Foster I.Joubert G.R.Kucera L.Nagel W.E.Peters F.,IOS Press BV,9275452,9781643680705,,,English,Adv.

Meanwhile, Machine Learning (ML) based on established models has seen a surge of interest in the High Performance Computing (HPC) community, especially through the use of high-end accelerators, such as Graphical Processing Units(GPUs), including HPC clusters of same. In our work, we are motivated to exploit these high-performance computing developments and understand the scaling challenges for new-biologically inspired-learning models on leadership-class HPC resources. These emerging models feature sparse and random connectivity profiles that map to more loosely-coupled parallel architectures with a large number of CPU cores per node. Contrasted with traditional ML codes, these methods exploit loosely-coupled sparse data structures as opposed to tightly-coupled dense matrix computations, which benefit from SIMD-style parallelism found on GPUs. In this paper we introduce a hybrid Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) parallelization scheme to accelerate and scale our computational model based on the dynamics of cortical tissue. We ran computational tests on a leadership class visualization and analysis cluster at Argonne National Laboratory. We include a study of strong and weak scaling, where we obtained parallel efficiency measures with a minimum above 87% and a maximum above 97% for simulations of our biologically inspired neural network on up to 64 computing nodes running 8 threads each. This study shows promise of the MPI+OpenMP hybrid approach to support flexible and biologically-inspired computational experimental scenarios. In addition, we present the viability in the application of these strategies in high-end leadership computers in the future. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.",Biologically-inspired computational models; Central Processing Units (CPUs); Irregular computation; MPI; Neuroscience; OpenMP; Sparse computation,,,Foster I.Joubert G.R.Kucera L.Nagel W.E.Peters F.,IOS Press BV,9275452,9781643680705,,,English,Adv.

As a consequence, this rapid advancement poses new computational and data processing challenges. We implement a novel remote sensing data flow (RESFlow) for advancing machine learning to compute with massive amounts of remotely sensed imagery. The core contribution is partitioning massive amounts of data into homogeneous distributions for fitting simple models. RESFlow takes advantage of Apache Spark and the availability of modern computing hardware to harness the acceleration of deep learning inference on expansive remote sensing imagery. The framework incorporates a strategy to optimize resource utilization across multiple executors assigned to a single worker. We showcase its deployment in both computationally and data-intensive workloads for pixel-level labeling tasks. The pipeline invokes deep learning inference at three stages; during deep feature extraction, deep metric mapping, and deep semantic segmentation. The tasks impose compute-intensive and GPU resource sharing challenges motivating for a parallelized pipeline for all execution steps. To address the problem of hardware resource contention, our containerized workflow further incorporates a novel GPU checkout routine and the ticketing system across multiple workers. The workflow is demonstrated with NVIDIA DGX accelerated platforms and offers appreciable compute speed-ups for deep learning inference on pixel labeling workloads; processing 21 028 TB of imagery data and delivering output maps at area rate of 5.245 sq.km/s, amounting to 453 168 sq.km/day-reducing a 28 day workload to 21 h. © 2008-2012 IEEE.",Big data applications; high performance computing; image classification; inference mechanisms; machine learning; supervised learning,Data handling; Graphics processing unit; Image classification; Learning systems; Pipelines; Pixels; Remote sensing; Semantics; Supervised learning; Big data applications; Data-intensive workloads; Geospatial applications; High performance computing; Homogeneous distribution; Inference mechanism; Remote sensing technology; Remotely sensed imagery; Deep learning; data processing; data set; image analysis; image classification; image processing; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite imagery,"Lunga, D.; National Security Sciences Directorate, United States; email: lungadd@ornl.gov",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,19391404,,,,English,IEEE J.
